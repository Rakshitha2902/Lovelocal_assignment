ALGORITHM:
Input: Accept a string from the user.

Initialize variables:

Set a counter (cont) to zero to keep track of the length of the last word.
Iterate through the string in reverse order:

Start from the last character of the string and move towards the beginning.
For each character:
If it is not a space, increment the counter (cont) by 1.
If it is a space, stop the iteration.
Output the result:

Print the value of the counter (cont), which represents the length of the last word.

EXPLANATION:

Start from the end of the string and move backward.
Count the characters until a space is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.
The count obtained is the length of the last word.
This algorithm ensures that the code finds and prints the length of the last word in the input string.
