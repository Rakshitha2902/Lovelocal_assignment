
Algorithm:

1. Initialization:
   - Initialize two candidates (`candidate1` and `candidate2`) and their corresponding counters (`count1` and `count2`) to track the majority elements.
   - Start with both counters at 0.

2. Finding Candidates:
   - Iterate through the input array (`nums`).
   - For each element:
      - If it matches `candidate1`, increment `count1`.
      - If it matches `candidate2`, increment `count2`.
      - If `count1` is 0, assign the current element as `candidate1` and set `count1` to 1.
      - If `count2` is 0, assign the current element as `candidate2` and set `count2` to 1.
      - If none of the above conditions match, decrement both `count1` and `count2`.

3. Counting Occurrences:
   - Reset counters `count1` and `count2` to 0.
   - Iterate through the array again.
   - Count occurrences of elements matching `candidate1` and `candidate2`.

4. Checking Majority:
   - Check if the counts of `candidate1` and `candidate2` are greater than ⌊ n/3 ⌋, where `n` is the length of the input array.
   - If yes, add the corresponding candidates to the result list.

5. Return Result:
   - Return the list containing the elements appearing more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Explanation:

The algorithm efficiently finds elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times in an array by iteratively narrowing down the candidates. It employs a voting mechanism where candidates are chosen and validated based on their counts. The final step ensures that the chosen candidates meet the specified frequency criterion.

This approach is particularly useful in situations where you need to find elements with frequencies greater than a certain threshold in a given array.
